🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Write a C program that takes the coordinates of a point `(x, y)` and determines where it lies in the Cartesian plane.

------------------------------------------------------------

📚 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- Conditional logic using if-else
- Handling multiple scenarios
- Working with user input in C

------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Write a C program that takes the coordinates of a point `(x, y)` as input and determines its location based on the following:

📍 OUTPUT:
- 🟢 "Origin Point" → if the point is at (0, 0)
- 🟡 "The point lies on the X-axis" → if y = 0 and x ≠ 0
- 🔵 "The point lies on the Y-axis" → if x = 0 and y ≠ 0
- 🟥 "1st Quadrant" → if x > 0 and y > 0
- 🟧 "2nd Quadrant" → if x < 0 and y > 0
- 🟪 "3rd Quadrant" → if x < 0 and y < 0
- 🟦 "4th Quadrant" → if x > 0 and y < 0

------------------------------------------------------------

💡 SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the coordinate point (x y): 3 -5

📤 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4th Quadrant
